# Ruva (Rust-Java)


This is a project to learn more about java and the jvm by wrtting rust library to interact
with different parts of the java ecosystem.

Initially, I will be focusing on the following areas:
- class file parsing
- jar file parsing
- Java source code parsing
- Maven project parsing


## Class File Parsing

The JVM takes .class files as input. These files are generated by the java compiler from java source code. The class file contains the bytecode that the JVM will execute. Along
with metadata about the class, fields, methods. Knowing how to parse these files tells us
exactly what information is available to the JVM when it runs the code. The java
byte code in the class file also contains all the information about method calls. So by parsing all the class files in a project, we can build a call graph of the project.

The documentation for the format is well written in the oracle docs:
